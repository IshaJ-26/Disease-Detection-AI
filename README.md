AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis Using Medical Images: A Deep Learning Approach


Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for early disease detection using medical images such 
as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system aims to assist healthcare 
professionals in diagnosing diseases with higher accuracy and efficiency.



Features

Automated Image Analysis: Uses deep learning models to analyze medical images.

Disease Prediction: Predicts potential diseases based on input medical images.

Explainable AI: Provides insights into model predictions with heatmaps and visual explanations.

Pre-Trained & Custom Models: Utilizes pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) and custom CNN architectures.

Dataset Processing & Augmentation: Prepares datasets with augmentation techniques for improved performance.

API for Integration: Offers REST API for integration with healthcare applications.
